# 🚀 Day 5 in My Journey to Learning Everyday! 🚀

Today, I took a deep dive into useParams, a React hook that allows me to access dynamic parameters directly from the URL. This is a key concept for building dynamic, data-driven applications. Here's a quick rundown of what I learned:

🌟 Key Takeaways:

1️⃣ What is useParams? 
  The useParams hook is a powerful feature from React Router that allows you to retrieve dynamic parameters from the URL. This means you can create routes that depend on data passed through the URL, enabling the display of different content based on the URL parameters.

2️⃣ Building Dynamic Navigation: 
  I used useParams to create a dynamic navigation bar in my app. By clicking on different user profiles, the URL updates with the user’s ID. The User component then uses useParams to fetch the corresponding user data and display it on the page.

3️⃣ Practical Example: 
  I built a simple user profile page. When a user clicks on a profile from the navigation bar, the URL updates with the user ID (e.g., /user/123). The useParams hook then grabs this ID and displays the corresponding user’s details without refreshing the page.

💡 Why This Matters: 
  Understanding and using useParams allows for more interactive and dynamic routing in React apps. It makes it easy to create personalized and context-sensitive content for users without needing to reload pages. It’s an essential skill for building modern web apps!
